## Required validation for code changes

Before completing any change that adds or modifies PHP, JavaScript, JSON, or
Markdown files, run both formatters from the repository root:

```sh
composer format
npm run format
```

Then verify the result:

```sh
composer format:check
npm run format:check
npm run lint
```

Do not leave formatting changes unreviewed. If a formatter modifies a file,
include those modifications in the requested change.
